    <h1>Get To The Presents! A Christmas Escape Room</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p>This christmas themed escape room is the first we've ever designed. We put in a lot of hard work to make it for you, and we really hope you enjoy it!</p>
    <p>You wakeup Christmas Morning as your eyes adjust to the light you loook around your room and realize that the door is closed. "Huh, that's wierd" you think.<br>
    You get up and try to open the door, <strong><em>it's locked!</em></strong>
    You yell for someone to help you but nobody hears you! It's up to you to escape! Click <strong><a href="Bedroom-Escape.html">START</a></strong> and set a forty-five minute timer.</p>
